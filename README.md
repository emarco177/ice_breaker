## 💡 What You'll Build 

This course takes you through building 7 real-world AI agent projects, from simple hello-world applications to advanced agentic systems:

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 👋 Hello World Agent | Branch (`project/hello-world`) | Your first AI agent - basic structure and LLM integration |
| 💻 Code Interpreter | Branch (`project/code-interpreter`) | AI-powered code execution and analysis |
| 🧠 ReAct Under the Hood | Branch (`project/react-under-hood`) | Understanding reasoning and acting patterns in AI agents |
| 🔍 [Ice Breaker](https://github.com/emarco177/IceBreaker) | External Repo | Social media profile analyzer |
| 📝 Medium Analyzer | External Repo | Content analysis and insights generator |
| 📚 [Documentation Helper](https://github.com/emarco177/documentation-helper) | External Repo | Intelligent documentation assistant |
| 🪞 [Reflection Agent](https://github.com/emarco177/langgraph-course/tree/project/reflection-agent) | External Repo | Self-improving agent with reflection and critique capabilities |
| 🔄 [Reflexion Agent](https://github.com/emarco177/langgraph-course/tree/project/reflexion-agent) | External Repo | Advanced self-correcting agent using reflexion techniques |
| 🤖 [Agentic RAG](https://github.com/emarco177/langgraph-course/tree/project/agentic-rag) | External Repo | Advanced retrieval-augmented generation system |

## 📚 Course Highlights 

- **7 Complete Projects** - From beginner to advanced implementations including Ice Breaker, Documentation Helper, and Code Interpreter
- **Real-World Applications** - Build agents that solve actual problems with live APIs

## 🤔 Learning Path 

### Phase 1: Foundations
1. **Hello World Chain** - Basic agent structure and LLM integration
2. **Code Interpreter** - Tool calling and code execution capabilities

### Phase 2: Real-World Applications
3. **Ice Breaker** - Data collection and social media integration
4. **Documentation Helper** - RAG implementation and knowledge management

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts
5. **Blog Analyzer** - Multi-step reasoning and content analysis
6. **Agentic RAG** - Self-correcting agents with memory and planning

## ▶️ Getting Started 

### 🛠️ Prerequisites 
- **This is not a beginner course** - Basic software engineering concepts needed
- Familiarity with: git, Python, environment variables, classes, testing and debugging
- Python 3.10+
- Any Python package manager (uv, poetry, pipenv) - but NOT conda!
- Access to an LLM (can be open source via Ollama, or cloud providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- No Machine Learning experience needed

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions 

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emarco177/langchain-course
   cd langchain-course
   ```
2. **Choose your learning path**
   
   **For branch-based projects:**
   ```bash
   # Start with Hello World
   git checkout project/hello-world
   uv sync
   uv run python main.py
   
   # Progress to Code Interpreter
   git checkout project/code-interpreter
   uv sync
   uv run python main.py
   ```
   
   **For external repository projects:**
   ```bash
   # Clone specific project repositories
   git clone https://github.com/emarco177/ice_breaker
   cd ice_breaker
   # Follow project-specific setup instructions
   ```

3. **Follow the commits**
   - Each commit represents a lesson or feature implementation
   - Use `git log --oneline` to see the learning progression
   - Checkout previous commits to understand the development process
